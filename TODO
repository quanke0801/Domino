SequenceMonitorPlugin should only monitor 1 sequence (use more plugins to monitor more sequences).

Modify SequenceMonitorPlugin to support resetting sequence and use map only, so that it can support monitoring objects added during simulation by overriding OnAddComponent().

Refactor all tests from functions into classes.

Subclasses of TestBase should override a function to specify list of ids to track (only at the end).

Create file IO plugin.

Create port.
